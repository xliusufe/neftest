Description: Provide test statistics for the goodness of fit tests based on zero regression characterizations of Tweedie, Bar-Lev and Enis class of distributions, and p-value of test statistic according to several specified distributions and the test statistic for the general NEF-PVFs, which is based on the proposed method.
